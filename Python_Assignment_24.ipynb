        "**1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?** <br>\n",
        "A.`def` statement is used to create a normal function. where as `lamba` expressions are used to create `Anonymous functions`. which can be assigned to a variable and can be called using the variable later in function. Lambda's body is a single expression. We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def statement. <br>\n",

        "1.Can be used to create Nameless/Anonymous functions inside some complex functions if we are planning to use it only once. <br>\n",

        "1.`map()`: The `map()` function is a type of higher-order. This function takes another function as a parameter along with a sequence of iterables and returns an output after applying the function to each iterable present in the sequence. <br>\n",
        "2.`filter()`: The `filter()` function is used to create an output list consisting of values for which the function returns true. <br>\n",
