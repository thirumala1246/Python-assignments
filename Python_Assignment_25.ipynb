        "A.When iterating through `iterable` objects like lists, tuples, sets, etc., an iterator is an object with a countable number of values. A class is used to implement iterators. It is based on lazy evaluation, which lets us avoid repetitive evaluation by putting the expression's evaluation on wait and storing it in memory until the item is specifically requested for. As soon as lazy evaluation is applied, only one memory location is needed to process a value, which reduces RAM wastage and eliminates the need to load the full dataset at once when employing a large dataset.An iterator should: To create an iterator that contains an iterable object, use the `iter()` keyword.The iterable object's next element can be called with the keyword `next()`. <br>\n",
        "Another simple technique to generate iterators is to use generators, which swap the word given for the return statement in a defined function. A function is used to implement generators. Generators use the same principles of lazy evaluation as iterators. The yield function in this case just returns the data without changing or stopping the function. As they will not store the complete sequence in memory, it will return a sequence of data in an iterable format that we must iterate over in order to use the data. <br>\n"

        "A.The yield statement suspends function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list. <br>\n",
