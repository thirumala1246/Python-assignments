    "**6.What are the three mode arguments that can be passed to the open() function ?**<br>\n",
    "Ans: The open() function creates a file object, which will be used to invoke methods associated with it.<br>\n",
    "**Syntax:** `fileobj = open(file_name, access_mode)` <br>\n",
    "`'r'`: Opens the file in read-only mode. Starts reading from the beginning of the file and is the default mode for the open() function.<br>\n",
    "`'w'`: Opens in write-only mode. The pointer is placed at the beginning of the file and this will overwrite any existing file with the same name. It will create a new file if one with the same name doesn't exist.<br>\n",
    "`'a'`: Opens a file for appending new information to it. The pointer is placed at the end of the file. A new file is created if one with the same name doesn't exist.<br>\n",
    "`'x'`: Exclusive Creating Mode: This mode is for the sole purpose of creating new files. Use this mode if you know the file to be written doesnâ€™t exist beforehand.<br>\n",
    "`'a+'`: Opens a file for both appending and reading.<br>\n",
    "`'r+'`: Opens a file for reading and writing, placing the pointer at the beginning of the file.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "**8.How do you tell the difference between read() and readlines() ?**<br>\n",
    "Ans: The `read()` method is used to read a string from an already existing file. if we passed a read() method specifies the number of bytes to be read from the opened file.<br>\n",
    "The `read()` method starts reading from the beginning of the file and if count is missing or has a negative value, then it read the entire contents of the file.<br>\n",
    "The `readline()` method is used to read a single line from the file. The method returns an empty string when the end of the file has been reached.<br>\n",
    "The `readline()` method return a string containing only a single newline character when a blank line is encountered in the file.<br>\n",
