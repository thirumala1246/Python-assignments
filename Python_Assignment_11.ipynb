    "**6. What are the five levels of logging?**<br>\n",
    "Ans: Log messages can have 5 levels - `DEBUG`, `INGO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` and `CRITICAL`. They can also include traceback information for exceptions. Logs can be especially useful in case of errors to help identify their cause.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What line of code would you add to your software to disable all logging messages?**<br>\n",
    "Ans: `logging.disable('DEBUG')`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?**<br>\n",
    "Ans: The only time when print() is a better option than logging is when the goal is to display a help statement for a command line application.\n",
    "The log record which is created with every logging event, contains readily available dingostic information.As opposed to just printing the errors, logging can be configured to disable output or save to a file. This is a big advantage to simply printing the errors.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Step in - Step In button will cause the debugger to execute the next line of code and then pause again.<br>\n",
    "Step Over - Step Over button will execute the next line of code, similar to the Step In button. However, if the next line of code is a function call, the Step Over button will “step over” the code in the function. The function’s code will be executed at full speed, and the debugger will pause as soon as the function call returns.<br>\n",
    "Step out - Step Out button will cause the debugger to execute lines of code at full speed until it returns from the current function.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?**<br>\n",
    "Ans: program will continue to runs normally after you click Continue,without stopping the debug process utill it reaches a breakpoint.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?**<br>\n",
    "Ans: One way to address this problem and gain better control over code where to break your code is to insert a breakpoint directly into the code. this will cause the debugger to pause."
